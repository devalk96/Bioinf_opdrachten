## crustacyanin
Crustacyanin is a carrier protein that binds the chromophore astaxanthin. 

**Structure**:  
The chromophore is bound to a large protein complex, 
this large protein complex is know as alpha-crustacyanin.
Alpha-crustacyanin is an aggregate of 16 crustacyanin monomers. Each of these monomers have bound to
a molecule of astaxanthin. These 16 monomers are arranged in 8 crustacyanin dimers. These dimers 
are called beta-crustacyanin. 

**Colour change**:
As previously explained, a crustacyanin monomers has an imbeded chromophore, one end of the 
chromophore is hidden in the crustacyanin, but another protrudes. When two monomers join, they will
cap the others protruding chromophore. This binding changes the molecular structure, which will 
result in a change in optical properties. When bound as a dimer, the chromophores will emit a 
blueish-green colour, when unbound the colour will shift to orange-red.

When the lobster is cooked, proteins will denature and this will result in the denaturation of the 
dimers, which will change the optical properties of the chromophore change the colour to orange-red.


### Physical properties
Crustacyanin constists of five types of subunits: A1, A2, A3, C1 and C2.
